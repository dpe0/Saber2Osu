Converts Beat Saber maps into OSU! maps.

If you launch it, it will let you choose a file - point it to a beat saber map .zip, and it will generate an .osz file next to it and close. It will convert all difficulties inside the beat saber map. I included a run.bat which launches the thing, but obviously it requires you to install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

I made this so that I could use beat sage without owning beat saber. **Recommended beat sage settings are: all events disabled**, the rest doesn't seem to matter. It might work well on human made beatmaps if there are no events.

There are no sliders or anything, converted beatmaps are literally copies of beat saber beatmaps but in osu.
